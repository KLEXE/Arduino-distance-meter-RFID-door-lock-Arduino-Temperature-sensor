Hallo,This is a simple project but I hope it is useful for all of you.
This project could you use for helping your daily activity, especially for measuring something or anything else that is useful from this project.
Here I would like to show Ultrasonic, LCD, and Potensiometer that are joined and operated by ARDUINO.
Step 1: Assemble Materials
 
Arduino Uno
Breadboard
HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic Sensor
LCD
Potensio Meter
Jumper Wires

Step 2: Connections
 
 
Trigpin is connected to Arduino 11 contact
Echopin is connected to Arduino 10 contact
VCC is connected to 5v contact, and
Grnd is connected to GND contact on Arduino
